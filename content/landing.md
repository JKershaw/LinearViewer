  I want to self-host Linear Projects Viewer. Repo: https://github.com/JKershaw/LinearViewer — Help me: 1) Clone and install dependencies, 2) Create a Linear OAuth app at linear.app/settings/api/applications with callback http://localhost:3000/auth/callback, 3) Create .env with the required variables, 4) Run it. Walk me through each step.
