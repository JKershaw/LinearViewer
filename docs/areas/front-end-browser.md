# Front end: browser code

## Waiting

- `public/app.js`: Home's Running and Up next are refreshed by parsing a whole page with
  `DOMParser` (LIN-4243). Waiting on you is drawn as a server fragment by the page's own
  function (LIN-4242); doing the same for the other sections would mean the client never
  parses a whole page. (Survey tally: LIN-4243.)
